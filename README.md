# Dropdowns

As you can see there are two dropdowns; one is single level dropdown and another is multi level dropdown. These dropdowns are implemented using HTML5 and Vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery is used.

This is an example for single level dropdown. If a user moves the cursor over 'News Category' tab, then the dropdown list opens. Upon hovering over the list, each option is highlighted. Once the cursor is moved away from the dropdown, the dropdown list is disappeared.

This is an example for multi level dropdown. In total it contains three dropdown levels. When a user clicks on 'Dropdown' tab, the third option in the given list, a dropdown list appears beside the first dropdown list. This list contains 4 options. The first two options have no sub-options but the third option leads to a list of sub-options by opening a dropdown list beside the second list. This third dropdown list has two options. If the cursor is moved away from the dropdown, it disappears.
