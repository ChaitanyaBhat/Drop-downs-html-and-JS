# Dropdowns

As you can see there are two dropdowns; one is single level dropdown and another is multi level dropdown. These dropdowns are implemented using HTML5 and Vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery is used.

This is an example for single level dropdown. If a user moves the cursor over 'News Category' tab, then the dropdown list opens. Upon hovering over the list, each option is highlighted. Once the cursor is moved away from the dropdown, the dropdown list is disappeared.
